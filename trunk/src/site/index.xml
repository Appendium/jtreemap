    <p>How to represent a tree in a map</p>

    <p>JTreeMap is a Java Swing component which reprensents hierarchical structure in a Treemap. This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treemapping">treemapping</a>.</p>

    <p>A tree structure may includes more or less important elements.
For example, in a tree structure of files, there can be files of big size.
It can be then interesting to know which repertory is the most important on a hard disk.
But, in a treeview, we can't distinguish the significant elements.
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap/">Treemap</a> makes it possible to represent each element in a rectangle of more or less big size according to its importance in the tree structure.
Moreover, we can add a code color which makes it possible to introduce new information into the representation of the tree structure.</p>

<p>For example, you can use Treemap to see :
<ul>
<li>which is the most important repertory on your hard disk.</li>
<li>if your portofolio of stocks is well distributed between the various branches of industry.</li>
<li>the map of the market (<a href="http://www.smartmoney.com/marketmap/">smartmoney.com</a>) </li>
</ul>
