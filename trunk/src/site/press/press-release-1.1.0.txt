Laurent Dutheil and ObjectLab are pleased to announce release 1.1.0 of
JTreeMap for Java 1.5+.

Open Source TreeMap/Heatmap components for Swing and SWT.

http://jtreemap.sourceforge.net

How to represent and visualize a lot of information at a glance is a 
hot topic in IT. A Treemap, also known as Heatmap, is an important tool
for this. A TreeMap graphically represents a hierarchical structure.

Typically, the hierarchy will involve a tree of nodes of different sizes
and different colours.  The size and colours are determined by parameters
such as the relative importance of a node in comparison to the full size.

JTreeMap is released under the business friendly Apache License v2.0.

It is available immediately for download via SourceForge or the Maven Central
Repository (both Maven 1 and Maven 2). The homepage has some very 
quick examples.

The library is small, lightweight and does not force you to adopt a
framework, but you can also use the Applet and Example Application 
out-of-the-box.

ObjectLab is not new to the open-source community having used numerous OS 
projects, It has recently launched the ObjectLab Kit family, including:
- QALab (http://qalab.sourceforge.net), a tool that keeps track over-time
  of the static analysis results from FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, Cobertura etc.
- DateCalculators (http://objectlabkit.sourceforge.net), a set of generic
  lightweight and thread-safe Date calculators for Business and Finance.
 
We would like to thanks our friends and colleagues for their help, 
reviews and suggestions.

Sorry for the long email... 

Feel free to pass on to people who may be interested.

Enjoy!!
