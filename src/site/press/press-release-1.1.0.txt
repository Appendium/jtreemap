Laurent Dutheil and ObjectLab are pleased to announce release 1.1.0 of
JTreeMap for Java 1.4+.

Open Source TreeMap/Heatmap components for Swing and SWT.

http://jtreemap.sourceforge.net

JTreeMap is released under the business friendly Apache License v2.0.

It is available immediately for download via SourceForge or the Maven Central
Repository (both Maven 1 and Maven 2). The homepage has some very 
quick examples.

The library is small, lightweight and does not force you to adopt a
framework.

ObjectLab is not new to the open-source community having used numerous OS 
projects, It has recently launched the ObjectLab Kit family, including:
- QALab (http://qalab.sourceforge.net), a tool that keeps track over-time
  of the static analysis results from FindBugs, Checkstyle, PMD, Cobertura etc.
- DateCalculators (http://objectlabkit.sourceforge.net), a set of generic
  lightweight and thread-safe Date calculators for Business and Finance.
 
We would like to thanks our friends and colleagues for their help, 
reviews and suggestions.

Sorry for the long email... 

Feel free to pass on to people who may be interested.

Enjoy!!
